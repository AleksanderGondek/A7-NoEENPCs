          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>A mod for BG:EE, BG:SOD, BG2:EE and <abbr title="Enhanced Edition Trilogy">EET</abbr>.</p>
          <p>The new NPCs introduced in the Enhanced Editions differ somewhat from the original cast and might not be everyone's taste. This mod provides a number of options to adapt them to your comfort level. You can make their first appearance more passive, giving you more control over whether or when to make the first contact. A small number of events will be slightly altered to make this possible.</p>
          <p>Alternatively it is also possible to simply remove one or more NPCs from the game. In that case you have the choice to make their personal or quest-related items available to everyone in stores or as loot.</p>
          <p>Additional components allow you to improve their portraits or customize their classes and/or kits to whatever you desire. You can find more detailed information below.</p>

        <div class="content">
          <h2>Compatibility</h2>
          <p>This mod should be compatible with every mod out there that doesn't significantly alter the starting locations and scripts of the Enhanced Edition NPCs. At present only Pecca's mod "EE_content_tweaks" is known to interfere with this mod in BG:EE. This mod will check if it has been installed and refuses to install relevant components if detected.</p>
          <p>This mod is fully compatible with Siege of Dragonspear. However, tweak options for SoD NPCs will be more restricted because of their close involvement in the plot.</p>
          <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Version 4.0 of the mod contains several structural changes. Do <u>not</u> install it together with earlier versions of this mod (3.5 or earlier)!</p>

          <h2>Installation</h2>
          <p>This is a WeiDU mod, that means it is very easy to install. Simply unpack the downloaded archive into your game's installation directory (where you can find the file "chitin.key") and run <em>&quot;setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.exe&quot;</em> (Windows) or <em>&quot;setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.command&quot;</em> (macOS). Follow the instructions and you are ready to start.</p>
          <p>It is strongly recommended to start a new game after installing the mod.</p>
          <p>To uninstall, run <em>&quot;setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.exe&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;setup-A7-ConvenientEENPCs.command&quot;</em> again and follow the prompts.</p>
