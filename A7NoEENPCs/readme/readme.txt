Disable Enhanced Edition NPCs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version: 2.0
Author:  Argent77


Overview
~~~~~~~~

A mod for BG:EE, BG2:EE and EET.

The new characters introduced in BG:EE and BG2:EE are not for everyone's taste.
Their character style differs greatly from the vanilla NPCs. Moreover, in 
several cases they are trying to force themselves into your party without you 
having a chance to ignore them. Some of their attached quests are also very 
difficult to solve without resorting to powergaming tactics.

This mod offers two possible solutions for this problem:
1. You can disable all or individual NPCs completely. Since the NPCs have only 
   been disabled, it is theoretically possible to reactivate them again later by 
   uninstalling the respective subcomponent(s) of this mod (if you have chosen to 
   disable them individually), or all at once.
2. You can keep all or individual NPCs from initiating conversations or events on 
   their own. A small number of events have been slightly altered to make this 
   possible. See below for more information.
